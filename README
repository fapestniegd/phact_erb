Whenever I'm creating erb templates for config files in puppet, I find the single-valued facts that facter provides to be very limiting. When I want to do something like re-configure a VPN, or shift mail server load around, I need to be able to query external sources and get the data from the *authorititative* source to make a config change. 

Note: a puppetmasterd server is not authoritative. If you want to know what your domain's MX records are, you don't query a puppetmasterd, because it doesn't matter what the puppetmasterd thinks the state should be. It's the actual MX records *in DNS* that clients are going to send mail to. 

(i.e. "Authoritative" == "where everything that isn't a puppet client looks for this information.")

Sure, the puppetmasterd may change that information in the authoritative source, but until it does, all the clients will use what DNS says anyway, so there's no point in configuring a system for what the state *will be*, you need it configured for what the state *actually is*.
