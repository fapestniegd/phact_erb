Whenever I'm creating erb templates for config files in puppet, I find the single-valued facts that facter provides to be very limiting. When I want to do something like re-configure a VPN, I need to be able to query external sources and get the data from the *authorititative* source to make a config change. Note: a puppetmasterd server is not authoritative. If you want to know what your domains MX records are, you don't query a puppetmasterd, because it doesn't matter what the puppetmasterd thinks the state should be. It's the actual DNS records that clients are going to send mail to. "Authoritative" == "where everything that isn't a puppet client looks for this information."
